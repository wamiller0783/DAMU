# DAMU
### Named after a Babylonian god of healing and exorcism.
The intent of the code in this repository is three-fold:
<ol>
  <li>To scrape the text of research journals within different sites and searches.</li>
  <li>Since specific areas of research will contain a lot of terminology specific to themselves, to create a corpus of text from the scraped journals.</li>
  <li>Vectorize the text and analyze using NLP. Analysis will focus on relationships between factors that may not have been previously recognized, but which become apparent when a corpus of text formed from thousands of research journals on a topic can be analyzed using NLP.</li>
</ol>
The initial focus of this code will be on research journals relating to cellular senescence and the mitigation of negative factors associated with aging; however, my intent is for this code to be easily applied to other areas of research.
